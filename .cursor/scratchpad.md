# Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to make all documentation pages under `/src/app/docs` fully responsive, ensuring they display correctly on mobile devices. Currently, the pages might not be optimized for smaller screen sizes, leading to a poor user experience.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Main Layout & Sidebar:** The primary challenge is adapting the main layout (`docs/layout.tsx`) and the sidebar (`docs/components/DocsSidebar.tsx`). The sidebar will likely need to be hidden behind a hamburger menu on mobile.
- **Content Overflow:** Code blocks and component previews on individual documentation pages might overflow or break the layout on small screens.
- **Component Responsiveness:** The interactive components themselves (e.g., animations, cursor effects) need to be tested and potentially adjusted to work well on mobile, which might not have hover events.
- **Consistency:** Ensuring a consistent and user-friendly responsive design across all documentation pages.

## High-level Task Breakdown

The plan is to tackle this iteratively, starting from the global layout and moving to individual pages.

1.  **Make Docs Layout Responsive**:

    - **Task**: Modify `src/app/docs/layout.tsx` and `src/app/docs/components/DocsSidebar.tsx`.
    - **Implementation**:
      - Add a hamburger menu button that is visible only on mobile.
      - The sidebar should be hidden by default on mobile and slide in when the hamburger menu is clicked.
      - The main content area should take up the full width on mobile when the sidebar is hidden.
    - **Success Criteria**: The sidebar is replaced by a hamburger menu on screens smaller than `md` (768px). Clicking the button toggles the sidebar's visibility. The layout looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

2.  **Verify and Fix Individual Doc Pages**:
    - **Task**: Go through each category in the `docs` folder (`cursor`, `interaction`, `typography`) and check the `page.tsx` file within each sub-directory.
    - **Implementation**:
      - Check for layout issues, especially with `pre` and `code` tags for code snippets, and the containers for the component demos.
      - Apply responsive tailwind classes to fix any overflow or alignment issues.
      - Ensure component demos are usable and look good on mobile.
    - **Success Criteria**: All documentation pages are readable and usable on mobile without horizontal scrolling (except for code blocks, which should scroll horizontally if needed).
